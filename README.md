# summarAIze

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I’ve always wished I could quickly grasp the key concepts of a research paper in less than 15 minutes. To make this possible, I’ve created this repo to upload self annotated research papers that I read and find interesting. I hope that these summaries will help others, like me, who want to understand research papers quickly and efficiently. My primary focus will be on papers in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

You can also find a quick summary for the same papers at https://medium.com/papers-i-found
